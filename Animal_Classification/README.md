🐾 Animal Classification Using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-powered Animal Classification Model that can predict the species of an animal from an uploaded image. The model analyzes key features like shape, color, and texture to classify the animal into one of 15 predefined categories.

🎯 Features

✅ Upload an image of an animal for classification
✅ Real-time prediction of the animal’s species
✅ Trained on 15 animal classes for accurate results
✅ Machine Learning-based model for automated classification

🛠 How It Works

1. Upload an image from your computer.
2. The model processes the image using deep learning techniques.
3. The predicted class is displayed on the screen.
4. The system can classify animals based on learned features like fur, scales, wings, and body structure.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python 🐍
Flask (for web framework) 🌐
TensorFlow/Keras (for model training) 🤖
OpenCV (for image processing) 🖼

📌 Future Enhancements

🏆 Support for more animal species
🎤 Add voice-based descriptions of predicted animals
📊 Improve accuracy with a larger dataset
